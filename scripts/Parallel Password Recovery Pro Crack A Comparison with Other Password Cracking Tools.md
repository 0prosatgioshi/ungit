You will see a list of available clients that can participate in the recovery. You can add or remove clients as you wish.
 
You can pause or resume the recovery at any time by clicking on the "Pause" or "Resume" button. You can also stop the recovery by clicking on the "Stop" button. If the software finds the password for your RAR archive, it will show it to you on a pop-up window. You can then copy or save the password to a file.
