Crash Team Racing offers a variety of game modes for different play styles and preferences. Whether you want to play solo, with friends, or online, you will find a game mode that suits you. Here are some of the game modes you can choose from:
 
- **Adventure Mode:** This is the main single-player mode, where you have to race through different hubs and tracks, collect trophies, relics, tokens, and gems, and face off against bosses. You can choose between Classic mode, which follows the original game's rules and mechanics, or Nitro-Fueled mode, which allows you to customize your character, kart, and difficulty.
- **Arcade Mode:** This is a casual mode where you can race on any track you have unlocked, with any character and kart you have unlocked or purchased. You can set the number of laps, the difficulty level, and even turn on mirror mode for a challenge. You can also play with up to four players locally in split-screen.
- **Time Trial Mode:** This is a mode where you can test your skills and speed on any track you have unlocked. You can race against the clock or against the ghosts of other players, including the developers and the best players in the world. You can also create your own ghosts and share them online.
- **Relic Race Mode:** This is a mode where you have to race on any track you have unlocked and break time crates to freeze the clock for a few seconds. The more time crates you break, the more time you save. You can earn sapphire, gold, or platinum relics depending on how fast you finish the track.
- **CTR Challenge Mode:** This is a mode where you have to race on any track you have unlocked and collect the letters C, T, and R that are hidden around the track. You also have to finish the race in first place to earn a CTR token of a certain color.
- **Crystal Challenge Mode:** This is a mode where you have to collect as many crystals as possible in a battle arena within a time limit. You can earn sapphire, gold, or platinum relics depending on how many crystals you collect.
- **Battle Mode:** This is a mode where you can compete with up to eight players online or four players locally in split-screen in various battle arenas. You can choose from five different game types: Limit Battle (match ends after a specified limit), Capture the Flag (teams must steal the opponent's flag to score points), Crystal Grab (players must collect crystals to score points), Last Kart Driving (players must avoid being eliminated by weapons or hazards), and Steal the Bacon (players must grab a golden bacon and bring it back to their base).
