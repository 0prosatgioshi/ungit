## What is Gds64dll and why do you need it?
 
Gds64dll is a 64-bit version of Gds32.dll, which is the original DLL file for Firebird.

If you are using a 32-bit Windows system, you only need Gds32.dll to connect to Firebird. However, if you are using a 64-bit Windows system, you need Gds64dll instead. This is because 64-bit applications cannot load 32-bit DLL files, and vice versa. Therefore, if you try to use Gds32.dll on a 64-bit system, you will get an error message saying "failed to load gds32.dll".
