# How to Use Topaz DeNoise AI 1.2.1 to Remove Noise and Enhance Detail in Your Photos
 
Noise is one of the most common problems that photographers face, especially when shooting in low-light conditions or with high ISO settings. Noise can degrade the quality of your photos, making them look grainy, blurry, and dull.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution that can help you eliminate noise and recover crisp detail in your images: Topaz DeNoise AI 1.2.1. This software uses a fundamentally new approach called deep learning, which allows it to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. By analyzing thousands of images, DeNoise AI has learned how to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that would have been impossible just a few years ago.

## How to Use Topaz DeNoise AI 1.2.1 for Different Types of Photography?
 
Topaz DeNoise AI 1.2.1 can handle any type of noise and detail in your photos, whether you're working on a photo of an exotic bird or the Milky Way galaxy. Here are some examples of how DeNoise AI can help improve the quality of your photos for different types of photography.
  
### Wildlife Photography
 
When photographing wildlife, you may need to use high ISO settings or crop your images to get closer to your subject. This can result in noisy images that lack detail and sharpness. With DeNoise AI, you can easily get rid of that noise while also improving image detail. You'll also snap attention right to the animal thanks to impressive detail recovery in the eyes, fur, and feathers.
 
Here is an example of a wildlife photo before and after using DeNoise AI:

To achieve this result, we used the following settings:

- AI Model: Clear
- Remove Noise: 0.50
- Enhance Sharpness: 0.25
- Recover Original Detail: 0.10
- Chroma Noise Reduction: 0.10

### Night Photography
 
Night photography can be challenging because of the low-light conditions and the need to capture sharp stars and details in the dark sky. Even with modern digital cameras, you may need to crank up your ISO settings to get proper exposure while ensuring crisp stars. This can result in noisy night skies that muddle the stars
