If you want to enjoy DoveZ - The Second Wave to the fullest, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:
 
- Choose the ship that suits your playstyle. The D-Phyton is better for dodging and weaving through enemy fire, while the D-Tonator is better for blasting through enemy formations. Experiment with both and see which one you prefer.
- Collect power-ups whenever you can. They will boost your firepower, shield, speed, and special weapon. Some power-ups are hidden in destructible objects, so shoot everything you see.
- Use your special weapon wisely. It can make a big difference in tough situations, but it has a limited charge. Save it for when you really need it, such as against bosses or large groups of enemies.
- Watch out for environmental hazards. Some levels have obstacles that can damage or kill you, such as falling rocks, lava, icebergs, and electric fences. Avoid them or destroy them if possible.
- Practice makes perfect. The game has a high difficulty level, especially in the later levels. Don't give up if you die a lot. Learn from your mistakes and try again. You can also adjust the difficulty setting in the options menu if you find the game too hard or too easy.
