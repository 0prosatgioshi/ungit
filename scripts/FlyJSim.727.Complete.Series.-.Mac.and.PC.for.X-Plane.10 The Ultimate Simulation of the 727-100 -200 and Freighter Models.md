The Boeing 727 is a three-engine jet that was designed in the 1960s as a medium-range airliner. It was popular among airlines for its versatility, reliability and performance. It could operate from short and unprepared runways, carry up to 189 passengers and cruise at speeds of up to Mach 0.9. The 727 was also one of the first jets to feature a rear airstair, which allowed passengers to board and disembark without ground equipment.
 
The FlyJSim 727 Series gives you a chance to experience flying this classic jet in X-Plane 10. You can choose from different models with different capacities, ranges and configurations. You can also customize your aircraft with various options such as winglets, weather radar, TCAS and more. The flight model is based on real-world data and feedback from pilots, and simulates the unique characteristics of the 727 such as its powerful engines, high-lift wings and draggy airframe.
 
One of the highlights of the FlyJSim 727 Series is the detailed 3D cockpit, which replicates the original analog instruments and systems of the 727. You can interact with every switch, knob and lever in the cockpit, and monitor the status of your engines, fuel, hydraulics, electrical and pneumatic systems. You can also use the custom FMC to program your flight plan, or fly by hand using the VORs and NDBs. The cockpit also features realistic lighting effects, reflections and shadows.
 
The FlyJSim 727 Series also comes with custom sounds that enhance the immersion of flying this jet. You can hear the roar of the Pratt & Whitney JT8D engines, the wind noise, the flap and gear movements, the cockpit alerts and warnings, and more. The sounds are recorded from real 727s and are synchronized with your actions and environment.
 
If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding jet to fly in X-Plane 10, you might want to give the FlyJSim 727 Complete Series a try. It is a well-made package that captures the essence of flying a vintage airliner in a modern simulator. You can learn more about it by reading this review[^2^] by X-Plane Reviews.
