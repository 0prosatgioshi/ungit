One of the software tools that Agilent Masshunter offers is Mass Profiler Professional (MPP), which is a powerful chemometrics platform for exploiting the high information content of MS data. MPP can be used in any MS-based differential analysis to determine relationships among two or more sample groups and variables. It provides advanced statistical analysis and visualization tools for GC/MS, LC/MS, CE/MS, and ICP-MS data.
 
Some of the features and benefits of MPP are:

- It allows differential analysis of two or more sample sets from one or multiple MS analysis platforms in a single project.
- It is designed for both mass spectrometrists and statisticians, with guided and advanced workflows.
- It provides comprehensive statistical tools including ANOVA, PCA, volcano plots, hierarchical trees, SOMs, and multiple methods for class prediction.
- It generates inclusion list for subsequent MS/MS-based analyses to facilitate identification of compounds of interest.
- The ID Browser allows integrated identification and annotation of compound using LC/MS Personal Compound Databases (METLIN, Pesticides, Forensics) and GC/MS libraries (NIST and Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics).
- MPP integrates well with MassHunter Profinder, Lipid Annotator and Classifier.
- Method automation capability in MPP enables the user to automate the complete analysis steps including experiment creation, normalization, data filtering and statistical analysis.
- It allows import and export of data in several formats to further extend and customize statistical analysis and visualization capabilities using R-Scripts.
- MPP 15.0 integrated with GeneSpring GX allows the correlation of pathways between MS (metabolomics, proteomics) and genomics data (microarray and NGS) in one project, enabling true integrated biology studies.

MPP is a chemometrics platform that can help you discover new insights from your MS data. Whether you are performing metabolomics, proteomics, environmental analysis, food safety testing, or any other application that requires differential analysis of MS data, you can benefit from MPP's features and capabilities.
