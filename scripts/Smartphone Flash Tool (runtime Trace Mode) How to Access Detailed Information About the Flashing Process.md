# How to Use Smartphone Flash Tool (runtime Trace Mode) to Flash Custom ROMs on MediaTek Devices
 
Smartphone Flash Tool (also known as SP flash tool) is a lightweight but reliable mobile phone tool for Windows OS that allows advanced users to streamline the way they are flashing custom ROMs to their Android devices built on top of the MediaTek architecture[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to use this tool to flash custom ROMs on any MediaTek device in a few simple steps.
 
## Prerequisites
 
- A Windows PC with SP flash tool installed. You can download the latest version of SP flash tool from [here](https://www.filehorse.com/download-smart-phone-flash-tool/).
- A MediaTek device with USB debugging enabled. To enable USB debugging, go to Settings > About phone > Tap on Build number seven times > Go back to Settings > Developer options > Enable USB debugging.
- A USB cable to connect your device to your PC.
- A custom ROM file that is compatible with your device. You can find custom ROMs for various MediaTek devices on trusted development forums and developers sites. Make sure you download the correct ROM for your device model and variant.
- A backup of your important data and files. Flashing a custom ROM will erase all your data on your device, so make sure you have a backup before proceeding.

## Steps to Flash Custom ROM using SP Flash Tool

1. Launch SP flash tool on your PC. You will see a dialogue box named Smart Phone Flash Tool (Runtime Trace Mode).
2. Click on the Scatter-loading button on the left and navigate it to the MTXXXX\_Android\_scatter\_emmc.txt file that is included in your custom ROM zip file. This file contains the partition information of your device.
3. Once you load the scatter file, you will see a list of partitions that will be flashed. You can uncheck any partition that you don't want to flash, but make sure you don't uncheck the ones that are essential for booting your device.
4. Click on the Download button at the top. This will start the flashing process.
5. Turn off your device and remove the battery if possible. Then connect your device to your PC using a USB cable. SP flash tool will detect your device and start flashing the selected partitions.
6. Wait for the flashing process to complete. You will see a green circle with a check mark when it is done.
7. Disconnect your device from your PC and reboot it. You have successfully flashed a custom ROM using SP flash tool.

- Make sure you have installed the correct drivers for your device on your PC. You can use the device drivers provided by your device manufacturer or you can install drivers for any device using PDANET[^2^].
- Make sure you have downloaded the correct custom ROM for your device. Flashing an incompatible ROM can cause your device to malfunction or even brick.
- Make sure you have enabled USB debugging on your device and allowed USB connection from your PC.
- Make sure you have enough battery charge on your device before flashing. It is recommended to have at least 50% battery level.
- If you get a BROM error or a connection error, try changing the USB port or cable or using a different PC.
- If you get a checksum error or an image error, try redownloading the custom ROM or using a different version of SP flash tool.
- If you get a status error or an authentication error, try formatting your device before flashing or using a different scatter file.
