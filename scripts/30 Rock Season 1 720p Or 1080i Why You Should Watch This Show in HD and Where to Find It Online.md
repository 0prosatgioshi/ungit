# Why You Should Watch 30 Rock Season 1 in 720p Instead of 1080i
 
If you are a fan of comedy, satire, and witty dialogue, you probably have heard of *30 Rock*, the award-winning sitcom created by and starring Tina Fey. The show follows the behind-the-scenes antics of a sketch comedy show on NBC, featuring a hilarious cast of characters played by Alec Baldwin, Tracy Morgan, Jane Krakowski, Jack McBrayer, and more.
 
But if you want to enjoy the show in its full glory, you might be wondering whether you should watch it in 720p or 1080i resolution. After all, both formats are considered high-definition (HD), and both are available on DVD and Blu-ray. So what's the difference?

The difference lies in how the images are displayed on your screen. 720p stands for 720 progressive scan, which means that each frame of the video is composed of 720 horizontal lines that are displayed at once. 1080i stands for 1080 interlaced scan, which means that each frame of the video is composed of two fields of 540 horizontal lines that are alternately displayed every 60th of a second.
 
While both formats have the same number of pixels (1280 x 720 for 720p and 1920 x 1080 for 1080i), they have different effects on the quality and smoothness of the video. Generally speaking, 720p is better for fast-moving scenes, such as action, sports, and comedy, because it reduces motion blur and judder. On the other hand, 1080i is better for slow-moving scenes, such as drama, romance, and scenery, because it preserves more detail and sharpness.
 
Therefore, for a show like *30 Rock*, which relies heavily on quick jokes, physical humor, and dynamic camera work, 720p is the preferred format. It will make the show look more crisp, fluid, and realistic. In contrast, 1080i will make the show look more soft, choppy, and artificial.
 
Of course, your viewing experience will also depend on other factors, such as your screen size, distance from the screen, lighting conditions, and personal preference. But if you want to follow the advice of experts and fans alike[^1^] [^2^], you should watch *30 Rock* season 1 in 720p instead of 1080i. You won't regret it!
