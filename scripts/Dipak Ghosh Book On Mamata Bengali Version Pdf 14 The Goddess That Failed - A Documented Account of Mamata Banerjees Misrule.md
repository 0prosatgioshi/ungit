# A Controversial Book on Mamata Banerjee by Dipak Ghosh
 
Dipak Ghosh, a former close associate of Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal and the leader of the All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), has written a book titled *Mamata Banerjee As I Have Known Her Or The Goddess That Failed*, which exposes many secrets and scandals of her political and personal life. The book, which was first published in English in 2012, has been translated into Bengali by Professor Sunanda Sanyal and is available as a pdf file on the internet.
 
The book claims to have documentary evidence, letters, photographs and comments to support its allegations against Mamata Banerjee, who is also known as Didi (sister) by her supporters. Some of the topics covered in the book are:

- Mamata Banerjee's lies and false claims of achievements.
- Mamata Banerjee's illegal occupation of a government residence.
- Mamata Banerjee's dubious marital status and family affairs.
- Mamata Banerjee's corruption and misuse of public funds.
- Mamata Banerjee's authoritarian and dictatorial style of functioning.
- Mamata Banerjee's intolerance and violence towards her critics and opponents.

The book has caused a lot of controversy and outrage among Mamata Banerjee's followers, who have tried to suppress its publication and distribution. They have also threatened and attacked the author, the translator and the journalists who have reported on the book. The mainstream media in West Bengal has largely ignored or censored the book, fearing reprisals from Mamata Banerjee and her party. The book has also been challenged in court by some of Mamata Banerjee's associates, who have accused it of defamation and invasion of privacy.
 
However, the book has also attracted a lot of interest and curiosity among the public, especially those who are disillusioned with Mamata Banerjee's governance and performance. The book has been downloaded and shared by thousands of people online, who have found it to be an eye-opener and a source of information that is not available in the mainstream media. The book has also sparked a debate on the role and responsibility of the media, the civil society and the judiciary in exposing and challenging the misuse of power by political leaders.

The book has also gained relevance in the context of the recent political developments in the country, where Mamata Banerjee has emerged as one of the most vocal and prominent opponents of the BJP-led central government. She has been leading a campaign to unite the opposition parties under a common platform to challenge the BJP in the 2024 general elections. She has also been projecting herself as a potential prime ministerial candidate, claiming that she has the support and respect of various regional and national leaders.
 
However, her efforts to forge opposition unity have faced several hurdles and contradictions, as some of the parties that she is trying to woo have their own ambitions and reservations. For instance, Mamata Banerjee has been at loggerheads with the Congress party, which is still the largest opposition party in the parliament and has a pan-India presence. She has also been critical of some of the regional parties that have allied with the BJP in some states, such as Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) in Bihar and Naveen Patnaik's Biju Janata Dal in Odisha.
 
On the other hand, Mamata Banerjee has also received support and praise from some of the opposition leaders who have appreciated her role in defeating the BJP in West Bengal assembly elections earlier this year. She has also held meetings with some of them, such as Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of Delhi and the leader of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Akhilesh Yadav, the former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and the leader of Samajwadi Party (SP), and Sharad Pawar, the veteran leader of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and a former union minister.
 
On Monday, Mamata Banerjee hosted Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav, the chief minister and deputy chief minister of Bihar respectively, at her official residence in Howrah. Nitish Kumar, who is also the leader of JD(U), had recently met Rahul Gandhi, the former president of Congress and a member of parliament, in Delhi. Tejashwi Yadav, who is also the leader of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), is the son of Lalu Prasad Yadav, a former chief minister of Bihar and a former union minister. The meeting was seen as a significant step towards building opposition unity ahead of 2024.
 
"It was a very positive discussion... Opposition parties need to sit together and strategise", Kumar said after meeting Banerjee. "I have made just one request to Nitish Kumar. Jayaprakash ji's movement started from Bihar. If we have an all-party meeting in Bihar, we can then decide where we have to go next. But first of all, we have to give a message that we are united", Banerjee said. "We want BJP to become zero", she added.
 
However, the BJP dismissed the meeting as a futile exercise and questioned the credibility and leadership of the opposition parties. "Is Nitish Kumar doing anything for Bihar as the CM? He met Mamata Banerjee. Mamata Banerjee met Arvind Kejriwal. Arvind Kejriwal met Sharad Pawar. The Opposition can carry on with this series of meetings. But who is the leader of the Opposition? What are its policies? What are they thinking for the country? There is no discussion on this", BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said.
 
"If the Opposition wants to fight the 2024 elections only with the basic mantra of 'Modi hatao', naturally they won't get public support", he added.
