But what is Hellgate London exactly? It is an action-RPG game that takes place in a post-apocalyptic London, where demons have invaded the world and humanity is on the brink of extinction. You play as one of the six classes of heroes who belong to the secret order of the Knights Templar, a group of warriors who fight against the forces of hell using advanced technology and magic. You can choose to play as a Blademaster, a Guardian, an Engineer, a Marksman, an Evoker, or a Summoner, each with their own skills and abilities.
 
The game combines elements of first-person and third-person shooters with traditional RPG mechanics. You can explore randomly generated levels full of enemies and loot, complete quests, level up your character, customize your equipment, and use various skills and spells to defeat your foes. You can also switch between first-person and third-person views depending on your preference and situation. The game offers a lot of variety and replay value thanks to its different classes, modes, monsters, and items.
 
However, the game also has its flaws and drawbacks. The graphics are dated and bland, the animations are stiff and awkward, the voice acting is mediocre at best, the story is shallow and clichÃ©d, the multiplayer mode is buggy and unbalanced, and the game suffers from frequent crashes and glitches. The game also requires a constant internet connection to play, even in single-player mode, which can be annoying and frustrating for some players. The game has received mixed reviews from critics and players alike, some praising its gameplay and atmosphere, others criticizing its technical issues and lack of polish.
