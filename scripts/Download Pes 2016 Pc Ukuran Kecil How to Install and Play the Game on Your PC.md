PES 2016 is not only a game that looks great, but also plays great. The gameplay is smooth and responsive, with realistic animations and ball physics. The players move and behave like their real-life counterparts, thanks to the PES player ID system that captures their skills and styles.

One of the most praised aspects of PES 2016 is the Master League mode, which lets you take control of a club and lead it to glory. You can manage every aspect of your team, from transfers and tactics to training and scouting.

PES 2016 is not without its flaws, however. The PC version of the game is a port of the PS3 version, which means that it has inferior graphics and performance compared to the PS4 and Xbox One versions. The game also suffers from some bugs and glitches, such as players disappearing or getting stuck in the pitch. The online mode can also be frustrating due to lag and disconnections. Some fans may also be disappointed by the lack of some licenses, such as the Bundesliga and the Champions League.
