It offers a range of features and services that make your driving experience more enjoyable and convenient. Here are some of the benefits of using Sensus Navigation in your Volvo car:

- You can connect to the Internet with a separate SIM card via Volvo on Call, or via Bluetooth or WiFi from your mobile phone. The Internet connection gives you access to online services such as Google Maps, Yelp, Wikipedia and more[^3^]. You can also use voice control to search for destinations, places of interest, weather information and more.
- You can send destinations to your car from your browser or through the Volvo on Call app with the Send to Car feature. This allows you to plan your trips ahead of time and avoid typing in addresses on the touch screen[^3^]. You can also share your location and estimated time of arrival with your contacts via SMS or email.
- You can get real-time traffic information via the Internet and Traffic Message Channel (TMC). The system will suggest alternative routes to avoid roadwork, accidents or other traffic related incidents. The information is read aloud to reduce the risk of taking attention away from driving[^1^].
- You can see selected 3D images of buildings and landmarks on the map to more easily recognize them in reality. You can also zoom in and out, rotate and tilt the map for different perspectives[^1^]. You can also switch between day and night mode, 2D and 3D mode, and different map themes.
- You can use EcoRoute, a green function that helps you choose a fuel-efficient route in combination with a good driving style to reduce fuel consumption. When you select EcoRoute, a fuel-efficient route is calculated based on speed limits and acceleration data for the specified route[^1^]. You can also view your driving statistics and tips on how to improve your eco-driving.
- You can enjoy Lifetime Map Update, which gives you updated maps at no extra charge. The updated maps are downloaded from http://support.volvocars.com. Entire regions and parts of entire regions are downloaded from this web portal. Smaller updates of already downloaded regions are downloaded wirelessly in the vehicle[^1^].
